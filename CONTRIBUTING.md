# Contributing Guidelines

🎉 **First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute!** 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## How can I contribute? 🤔

### Pull Requests 📣

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain the project's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible!
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to *50 characters or less*.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at *72 characters*.
- Use the body to explain the *what*, *why*, *vs*, and *how*.

## Hacktoberfest Guidelines 🌳

#### Good Practice ✅

- Comment on the issue to get assigned
- Create an issue before you make a Pull Request

#### Bad Practice ❌

- Creating pull requests without issue assignment will not be accepted and will be closed.

After this, the project maintainers will review the changes and will merge your PR if they found it good, otherwise we will suggest the required changes.
