        <h1>Hacktoberfest</h1>
        <h3>Hello.... <span>I'm</span>Ibrahim Musa</h3>
        <p>Every October, over 100k participants from all over the world participate in Hacktoberfest by going on
            GitHub, choosing a repository, and contributing to it.

            Contributions are done by submitting a pull request (PR) to any repository that is participating in
            Hacktoberfest. Once your pull request is deemed accepted (we'll go over how that works in the next
            sections), it will count into your participation in Hacktoberfest.

            To successfully participate in Hacktoberfest, you will need to submit at least 4 accepted pull requests to
            any repositories that are participating in Hacktoberfest.

            Once Hacktoberfest is over, which is at the end of October, the first 55,000 participants to have submitted
            at least 4 accepted pull requests will receive a t-shirt with a swag pack. And, starting this year,
            maintainers will be able to receive swag packs as well!</p>
